## üëã Introduction

UWSummit was a dynamic platform where University of Waterloo students could pit their LinkedIn profiles against each other in a friendly "Who's More Cracked?" ELO-based ranking system. Users could vote on matchups, climb the leaderboard, and showcase their achievements.

The platform aimed to create a fun, engaging way for students to see how their profiles stacked up and to discover impressive peers within the Waterloo community.

In a whirlwind launch, UWSummit achieved:
*   **1,000+ registered users**
